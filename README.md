# VisualRank-Using-Image-Similarity
This project is based on the well-known PageRank algorithm developed by Google to help in ranking web pages. 
A similar simplistic version of it is utilized here to rank images based on similarity. An 1400x1400 similarity matrix (sim.mat)
is provided, which represents 1400 images from which the top ten heart-shaped look-a-likes should be searched for and then ranked. 

Matlab 2018a (Student Version) was utilized for this proct. 
Unzip the 1400 images in the MPEG7.zip file and add the path to your Matlab environment.
To apply the modified pagerank alg.(visualrank), an adjacency matrix is formed for the graph that connects the images by visual hyperlinks.

Run the matlab code as is and the output will display the top ranked heart-shaped look-a-like images.
